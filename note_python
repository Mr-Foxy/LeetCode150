Use of Stack:
	stack = []
	stack.append
	stack.pop

Round toward 0:
	int(float(a) / b)

Note on Quick Sort
	if p < r:
		it prevents two situation:
			p == r and p > r

Pdb:
	import pdb
	pdb.set_trace
	
	These two sentences could set breakpoint on program

Nested Func:
	python could define function within a function 

When going through half List, use:
	slow = head
	fast = head
	while fast != None and fast.next != None:
		fast = fast.next.next
		slow = slow.next

	Then slow would be half-point of the list

Reverse a sorted list
	def reverse(self, head):
		if head == None:
			return None
		current = head
		nh = head
		while current.next != None:
			tmp = current.next
			current.next = current.next.next
			tmp.next = nh
			nh = tmp
		return nh
